# Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end HR analytics workflow focused on employee attendance behavior. The dashboard analyzes presence %, work-from-home (WFH) %, and sick leave (SL) trends across employees, dates, and days of the week. The goal is to enable HR teams to quickly identify attendance patterns, operational risks, and workforce planning signals through interactive reporting.

The solution was built using Power BI and Excel, with emphasis on clean data modeling, accurate DAX measures, and clear KPI-driven visual design.
